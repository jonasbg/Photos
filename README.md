# Jonas Photo Utility
This is a simple utiliy. Spin it up with docker and mount a volume to `/data`. The image will then give you a list of the images for the first day it will found. For instance, if there is photos from today, only those will be shown. But if theres no photos for a week, then that day last week will be shown.

## Integration
Integrate it with what you would like. Personally I've integrated it with Apple iOS Shortcuts app to show me the latest set of images for a given directory.
